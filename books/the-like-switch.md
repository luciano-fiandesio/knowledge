## The Friendship formula

The Friendship Formula consists of the four basic building blocks: 
**proximity**, **frequency**, **duration**, and **intensity**. 
These four elements can be expressed using the following mathematical formula: 

    Friendship = Proximity + Frequency + Duration + Intensity

-   **Proximity** is the distance between two individual and the exposure of one individual towards another individual
    -   People who share physical space are more likely to become attracted to one another even when no words are exchanged
-   **Intensity** is how strongly you are able to satisfy another person’s psychological or physical needs through the use of verbal and nonverbal behaviors
-   **Duration** has a unique quality in that the more time you spend with the person, the more influence you have on that person
-   Duration usually has an inverse relationship with frequency
    -   The more frequent you see them, the last time you spend
    -   The less we can see them, the more time we tend to spend with them

We constantly send **friends** or **foe** signals and, at the same time,
we scan the environment for potential threats **all the time**.

A classic for signal is the **urban scowl**. This is commonly developed by people who live in rougher neighborhoods.
The urban scowl is like a "don't mess with me" kind of sign.

## Non-verbal signals

When you meet people, especially for the first time, ensure that you send the right nonverbal cues that allow others to see you in a positive rather than neutral or negative light.

Three critical and nonverbal cues: _eyebrow flash_, _head tilt_, and a _real smile_

### Eyebrown flashes

Prolonged eye contact between two people indicates intense emotion, whether in love or hostility

A long eyebrow flash will actually send a foe signal

### Head tilt

A head tilt to the right or left is a non-threatening gesture

People who tilt their head when meeting other people are seen as more trustworthy and attractive

### Smile

A smile is a powerful friend signal. Smiling faces are judged to be more attractive, more likable, and less dominant

- A smile portrays confidence, happiness, and enthusiasm, and acceptance
- Genuine smiles are more symmetrical and timed differently than fake smiles
- Learning to produce a real smile at will, particularly when you don’t feel in the mood to display it, takes practice
- _Smile releases endorphins, which give us a sense of well-being. When we smile at other people, it is very difficult for them not to smile back. This return smile causes the target of your smile to feel good about themselves, and, as we will learn in a later chapter, if you make people feel good about themselves, they will like you._

### Touching

Touch is important in making friends, as studies have concluded that even the most fleeting touch can have a dramatic influence on our perceptions and relationships.
A risk-free way to measure the strength of a new relationship is to accidentally touch or brush against the hand of your person of interest:
Most people will tolerate an accidental touch, but they will unconsciously send nonverbal signals indicating the acceptance or rejection of the touch

### Isopraxism

When you first meet someone and want to gain their friendship, make a conscious effort to mirror their body language.
However, the **absence of mirroring is** a foe signal and the brain will take notice when two people are out of synchrony during personal interactions.

### Leaning

People tend to lean towards people they like and distance themselves from people they don’t like

### Head nods

Head nods can have various different cues towards the speaker

- Verbal nudges let the speaker know not only that you are listening but also validating the speaker’s message with a verbal confirmation
- Focused attention shows the speaker what they are saying is important to you


### Foot signals

Foot signals in group circles can be very telling, as feet pointed towards the center show closed groups, and feet and body positions opened up shows receptivity to new members

### Groups

- If you can’t readily find common ground, you can default to music because everyone likes music, even if not the same music
- When you see people again after meeting them, call them by their names. This means a lot to them
- Conversational bridge back’s, references to previous conversations, show that you’re not a newcomer to the group
