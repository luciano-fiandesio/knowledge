_Always remember that knowledge without action is knowledge_

The Friendship Formula consists of the four basic building blocks: 
**proximity**, **frequency**, **duration**, and **intensity**. 
These four elements can be expressed using the following mathematical formula: 

    Friendship = Proximity + Frequency + Duration + Intensity

-   **Proximity** is the distance between two individual and the exposure of one individual towards another individual
    -   People who share physical space are more likely to become attracted to one another even when no words are exchanged
-   **Intensity** is how strongly you are able to satisfy another personâ€™s psychological or physical needs through the use of verbal and nonverbal behaviors
-   **Duration** has a unique quality in that the more time you spend with the person, the more influence you have on that person
-   Duration usually has an inverse relationship with frequency
    -   The more frequent you see them, the last time you spend
    -   The less we can see them, the more time we tend to spend with them
